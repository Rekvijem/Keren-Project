# Keren Project - Smart House at its best.

So at this point you may be wondering... What is the Keren Project?
The simplest way to explain it would be a revolutionary new AI capable of serving you to her fullest.
Whatever you need done, she will do with your consent.

# So what can she do now?

So far we have more or less implemented these features (and this is only a small part):

 - Speech recognition - within the SL4A, Android APP Ineeded.
 - Recognize the language - Credit to the Author Kent Johnson for the package used.
 - Text-to-Speech in any language - Not completely ready, code not included yet.
 - Weather - Almost Ready.
 - Profiles - Ready!
 - Log everything - Ready!
 - Verify legitimate requests - Ready! *Not included in the current client code.
 
 With upcoming features such as:

 - Air Conditioning Control.
 - TV Control.
 - Home Lights Control.
 - Coffee Machine automation (Yes!)
 - An Automatic Plant Watering System.
 - Online IP Camera(s) Control
 - Native android application. (A Regular APK)

# Bugs:

 - UTF-8 Problem - Can't send Hebrew/Russian or other unique language strings.
 
We hope to see you contribute to our project.
