# Keren Project - Smart House at its best.

So at this point you may be wondering... what is the Keren Project?
The simplest way to explain it would be a revolutionary new AI capable of serving you to her fullest.
Whatever you need done, she will do with your consent.

# So what can she do now?

So far we have more or less implemented these features (and this is only a small part):

 - Speech recognition - within the SL4A, Android APP Ineeded.
 - Recognize the language - Credit to the Author Kent Johnson, for the package.
 - Text-to-Speech in any language - Not completely ready, code not include yet.
 - Weather - ready, just ineeded to return weather string that contains sentence.
 - Profiles - Ready!
 - Log everything - Ready!
 - Verify legitimate requests - Ready! not include in the client code which intend to give the IMEI ID.
 
 With upcoming features such as:

 - Air Conditioning Control.
 - TV Control.
 - Home Lights Control.
 - Coffee Machine automation (Yes!)
 - Auto Plant watering system.
 - Online IP Camera's control
 - Native android application. (Regular APK.)

# Bugs:

 - UTF-8 Problem - can't send Hebrew / Russian or other unique language String.
 
 We hope to see you contribute to our project.
